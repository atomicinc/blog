<p>Nowadays, it is (thankfully) increasingly rare to find software that does not have automated tests. Whether we are discussing unit tests, integration tests, regression tests, performance tests or blood tests (just kidding), most products, from the tiniest libraries to the most complete systems, have tests that can be run automatically.</p>
<p>A big part of the success of the Ruby programming language and ecosystem was the ease with which testing suites could be created. A similar dynamic is occurring in the Nodejs world, where tools such as mocha have made testing (relatively) easy to do.</p>
<p>As a result, most companies nowadays have some form of automated testing team to build, execute and perform automated tests, in addition to a "QA" team that runs a separate suite of manual or mixed automated-manual tests.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most companies I have seen still do it incorrectly.</p>
<p>The very essence of automated tests is <em>not</em> to get the tests to execute automatically. That is an important and noble goal. It is necessary but it is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The true purpose of automated tests is to get the <em>engineers</em> to own running and seeing the output of tests <em>with no additional help</em>.</p>
<p>In a one- to two-person development environment, tests should be fully automated, but can be launched manually with a single command: "npm test", "mocha", "rspec", "make test", etc.</p>
<p>In large groups, especially where a product is composed of multiple sub-products, the single command should run the unit tests, while each check-in should launch both unit tests and integration tests.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, not only the <em>tests</em> must be automated, but test setup and tear-down - configuration, metadata, stubs, services, performance monitors - must be fully automated as well. It is crucial that two requirements always are met:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Anyone</strong> can perform the tests with a single command and no special knowledge</li>
<li>The tests are <strong>always</strong> identical</li>
</ol>
<p>Any level of manual pre-test setup or post-test tear-down, no matter how minor, will violate both of the requirements.</p>
<p>Any level of manual setup, any level of human involvement, means you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not have</span> automated testing.</p>
<p>Why is it so important to have single-click (or single-command) testing?</p>
<ol>
<li>Guarantee the results are reliable and reproducible, and hence meaningful</li>
<li>Save costs on human labour.</li>
<li>Enable engineers to run tests themselves, thus reducing the time to feedback. "Fail fast and fail often."</li>
</ol>
<p>QA testers often are relatively cheap labour, certainly compared to software engineers who would need to build more automated tests. But it is not a 1:1 comparison. For each successful release of software, there are many interim iterations. Each one of them requires a full testing suite. The time your (expensive) engineers are awaiting results, or working on something else and then suffering the context switch, is multiplied by the number of tests. Each iteration that undergoes some manual setup and teardown, let alone manual tests, is all of those lower-cost testers performing manual labour. The engineer may cost 3-4x the tester, but when the tester performs the same activities 10 times, his or her time suddenly gets very expensive indeed!</p>
<p>Most important, though, is your speed of iteration. Here is Deitcher's Law of Release Iteration:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your speed of release iteration is directly proportional to your speed of test iteration</p></blockquote>
<p>The faster you can test and get back to your engineers, the faster you can release.</p>
<p>In most organizations I have seen, especially those wherein the CEO wants to release faster, there are two bottlenecks. The first is test iteration speed. They just cannot test reliably enough or quickly enough.</p>
<p>The second is cultural, and is the subject of another article, coming soon to a browser near you.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>If you want to release more product, faster, with more stability and reliability, check your level of fully automated testing.</p>
<p>If you have a QA team of any kind - not engineers building test frameworks, but people dedicated to setting up, tearing down and running actual tests - chances are pretty good testing is your bottleneck.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I have almost <em>never</em> seen a technology company that could not accelerate its release cycles by double-digit percentages or more, while reducing costs and improving employee satisfaction, by dramatically improving its testing procedures.</p>
