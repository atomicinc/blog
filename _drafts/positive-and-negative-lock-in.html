<p>In an earlier article about GoPro, I mentioned two ways to lock in a customer, coining them "Negative Lock-In" and "Positive Lock-In." Today, we will go through each of these in a little more depth and with some examples.</p>
<p>If you run a business, then you are concerned every single day that tomorrow, your customer will leave. Inevitably, businesses look for "lock-in", a way of guaranteeing users will stick around.</p>
<p>As discussed, there are two basic types of lock-in: negative and positive.</p>
<h3>Negative Lock-In</h3>
<p>Negative Lock-In is a type of lock-in wherein the customer will pay a hefty price for leaving. They may leave anyways, but the cost of doing so often is sufficient to convince them not to leave.</p>
<p>One type of negative lock-in is "format" lock-in. Until recently, the only software that could read Microsoft Word files reliably was, well, Microsoft Word. Unless you were willing to discard thousands of important old files, your next word processor was going to be the same as your last, i.e. Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>Another type of negative lock-in is contractual. In exchange for a better price, the customer agrees to a three-year contract instead of a one-year contract. This one is slightly less pernicious to the customer since they received benefit (a discount) for it at the beginning, and entered into the agreement willingly. However, contractual lock-in is riskier than it seems. When dealing with a business customer, by the time you are one half or two-thirds of the way through the term, the responsible party at the customer is likely to have changed. The person inheriting the contract did not gain the benefit, and may not be as thrilled with the current state.</p>
<p>The real damage from contractual lock-in actually is <strong>the seller</strong>. By having your customer locked not only to you but to your revenue stream for a long time, complacency and, at times, even disdain for the customer and their needs tends to settle in. By the time renewal comes along, the biggest enemy of renewal often is not the <em>terms</em> of the agreement over the last several years, but rather how <em>you</em> have treated them over that period.</p>
<h3>Positive Lock-In</h3>
<p>Positive Lock-In, by contrast, is where you make it so that the customer <em>really wants</em> to stay with you. You continually provide additional value, making not the <em>cost</em> of leaving high, but the <em>loss of value</em> high.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have a comparable price to your competitor, but you provide significantly better customer service, you have positive lock-in.</li>
<li>When you provide a similar CRM platform yo your competitor, but you also enable business analytics to grow your customer's business, you have positive lock-in.</li>
<li>Most importantly, when you create a unique addition that would not be possible without you, you have positive lock-in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Trouble with Tribbles (and Investors)</h3>
<p>I have seen many pitches - and done a few - in my day. Too many investor ask the same question: "how are you going to lock the customer in?" They are asking, in essence,<br />
"what negative lock-in do you have?"</p>
<p>The real question to ask is, "how are you going to make the customer want to stay with you?" or, "what positive lock-in do you have?"</p>
<p>The problem with negative lock-in is that it is a double whammy. First, it creates complacency on your part. Recently, a friend who has done business with a well-known large database software vendor described the environment there as "worse than a caricature. They have absolute disdain for the customer. Customers are just an ATM to squeeze." While much of this clearly derived from the culture laid down at founding and the ethics of the leaders, part of it can be ascribed to lock-in. If the customer has nowhere else to go, why put in the effort.</p>
<p>This type of disrespect for customers to invest <strong>significant efforts</strong> to try and get away from you once they can. At signing time, they are very happy because they fell they have gotten the best product, service or deal available. By the time renewal comes around, they feel cheated and taken advantage of. While many customers who will want to leave feel they cannot, others who might have stayed and remained solid, growing reference customers will choose to leave just to get away from you.</p>
