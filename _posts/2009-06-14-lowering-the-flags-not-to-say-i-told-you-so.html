<p>On Saturday, June 13, 2009, the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124489639859012503.html" target="_blank">reported</a> that Six Flags filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. According the to the article, Six Flags is yet another victim of the deteriorating economy. I beg to disagree.</p>
<p>Just under a year ago, in early August 2009, the same newspaper reported that Six Flags management had a turnaround plan. I <a href="{{ site.url }}/2008/08/06/we-are-not-amused-the-economics-of-amusement-parks/" target="_blank">argued</a> at the same time that the plan was poorly constructed and ignored too many of the economic realities of the parks and, especially, their patrons. I wish I were wrong - Daniel Snyder, among others, would have saved a lot of money, and many jobs would have been saved, since the restructuring is likely to lead to trimming and layoffs - but apparently we were right.</p>
